MY ORIGINAL AI PROMPT:
[Paste the prompt you used to generate your problem set here]
I am a highschool begginer in python but have some experience with java up to things like arrays, while loops, and making both methods and classes. I do not know much of python at all. Give me 5 practice problems for python that cover basics like variables, while loops, arrays, asking for user input, and conditionals like if, if else, else. These are to help me learn, so go easy on me.
Example: "I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. 
I have some experience with Java. Can you create 5-7 practice problems that cover..."

"""
1. Simple Number Guessing Game

Ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 10.

If the guess is correct (choose a fixed number, like 7), print "You guessed it!"

Otherwise, print "Try again!" and keep asking until they guess correctly.

Concepts: variables, input, while loop, if-else

2. Sum of Numbers

Ask the user to enter numbers one by one.

Keep adding them to a total sum.

When the user enters 0, stop asking for numbers.

Print the total sum of all numbers entered (except the 0).

Concepts: input, while loop, variables

3. Check Even or Odd

Ask the user to enter a number.

Print "Even" if the number is even, or "Odd" if the number is odd.

Concepts: input, variables, conditionals, modulo operator %

4. List and Print Fruits

Create a list of 5 fruits (hard-coded).

Print each fruit on a new line using a loop.

Concepts: lists (arrays), loops

5. Find the Largest Number

Ask the user to enter 5 numbers (one by one).

Store them in a list.

Find and print the largest number from the list.

Concepts: lists, input, variables, loops, conditionals
