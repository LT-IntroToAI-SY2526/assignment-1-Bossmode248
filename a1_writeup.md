# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?
    My initial experince with Python was basically non-existent. Sure, I watch a streamer named Doug that uses python with his AI projets on stream, but It won't let me mgically understand everything. i am much more knowledgable in Java since its what I've been using for the past year in classes. Currently im still using java as I am tak AP computer science class. 
2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.
   I used AI to effectively explain the concepts like variables and loops in python and how to do them. I didn't ask for specific answers to my problems, I only asked for it to explain the tools I needed to build the things the AI wanted me to make. I feel like I now understand how to transwer concepts from java to Python.
3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?
    The concept most challenging to me currently is the data types thing. Not assigning the values themseles, but the fact I have to change the data type of a variable to be able to use them in some things, like trying to print an int. To print an int, I have had to convert it into a string, otherwise I just get an error. 
4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
    I've learned that AI can be a good assistant in learning new things as long as you use the AI with the intention to learn, and not to just get the answers. You also can't lean on it too much. You have to try, and most likely fail. But that's fine, as we can learn from our coding mistakes and get better.
